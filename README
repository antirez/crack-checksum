This small program is useful when trying to find the checksum used by
simple RF protocols packets, like the ones sent by TPMS sensors, weather
stations and so forth. It will try all the checksum 8 polynomials and
initalization values, xor and addition of bytes, in order to find something
matching the vectors provided.

It is best to provide at least few vectors (three or more) for the program
to work more reliabily. The program will try a matching checksum at
different positions, starting and ending at all the offsets where a
message of the specified minimal length is found. However it looks for
the checksum always at the end of the sequence, since all the protocols
I saw so far have the checksum byte at the end.

There is no use interface whatsoever, you have to edit the program C
file and fill the main() function with your data.
